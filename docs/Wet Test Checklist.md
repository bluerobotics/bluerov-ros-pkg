# Wet Test Checklist

If you don't have a body of water within a couple of feet of your workstation, performing a wet test can turn into a big ordeal. Here is a checklist of items that we use to ensure everything is good to go before leaving for a wet test or actual mission.

## Preparation

Before you head out for a wet test, make sure that you do as much preparation as possible ahead of time. In particular, make sure that the end-to-end control of individual thrusters is as expected.

## What to Bring

Item | Notes
--- | ---
ROV | dry-run motors, teleop control, and camera ahead of time
ROV batteries | check charge
external camera | check charge
teleop controller | check charge and don't forget wireless dongle
workstation/laptop | check charge
weights | to fine-tune buoyancy
silicone grease |

## Final Checks

Slowly place the ROV into the water. Hold the ROV near the surface for a short period of time and check for leaks. If leaks are detected, immediately pull the ROV out of the water and make sure the electronics inside the enclosure are dry and safe.
